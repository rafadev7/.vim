# Summary
It's just my vim setup.

I've installed in Arch Linux using: `pacman -S vim`

I've installed Vundle following this instructions in: https://github.com/gmarik/vundle

Then I've created a symling pointing to my .vimrc file just to move this file into my ~/.vim folder, using: `ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc`

That's all.
